This custom chess engine, developed using the [Sebastian Lague Chess Challenge API](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge), combines advanced techniques to play chess efficiently. 


It features a Negamax Algorithm for decision-making, Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimized searches, and evaluation logic that balances piece values and positional scoring, with added rewards for creating or escaping checks.

Tested against the API’s "Evil Bot," the engine demonstrates strong midgame and endgame performance, using depth-limited searches to balance speed and accuracy. 


An executable file is available, so anyone can run and test the engine easily.

Future plans include adding an opening book, endgame tablebases, and dynamic depth adjustments. Contributions and feedback are welcome! ♟️
