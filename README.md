This is a custom chess engine developed using the Sebastian Lague Chess Challenge API(https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge).  

It leverages advanced techniques to play efficiently and intelligently:



Key Features

Negamax Algorithm: Simplifies decision-making in two-player games.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes search by reducing unnecessary evaluations.

Piece and Position Evaluation: Combines material value with positional scoring for strategic play.

Check Awareness: Rewards moves that create or escape checks.




Highlights


Tested against the API’s "Evil Bot" with strong performance in midgame and endgame scenarios.

Depth-limited search balances speed and accuracy.

Future Plans

Integrate an opening book and endgame tablebases for improved play.

Enhance search efficiency with dynamic depth adjustments.
